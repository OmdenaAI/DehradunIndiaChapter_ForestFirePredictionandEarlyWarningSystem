## Python **virtualenv** setup for local development üêç

If you don't want to use Docker for local development, you can also use a Python virtual environment.
How to setup a Python virtual environment for local development:

### 1. Install virtualenv package

```bash
pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```

### 2. Make and activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

or

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

#### On Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS and Linux

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies within the virtual environment

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Develop and test your streamlit app within the virtual environment

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 5. After development, deactivate virtual environment

```bash
deactivate
```

## Dockerfile for local development üê≥

This template contains a Dockerfile for local debugging and testing of the project, before deploying the project to Streamlit Cloud. This shall ease the process of developing and deploying projects to Streamlit Cloud, without endless back and forth trial-and-error between local development environment, GitHub and Streamlit Cloud.

The Dockerfile is based on `python:3.11-slim` image and shall mimic the Streamlit Cloud runtime as closely as possible.

**Hint**: If you run the Dockerfile locally on a Windows host system, you have to uncomment the `[server]` settings in the `.streamlit/config.toml` file. Comment these lines again before deploying the project to Streamlit Cloud.

## Streamlit Cloud deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è

To deploy the project to Streamlit Cloud, you have to create a new project on Streamlit Cloud and connect it to your GitHub repository.
